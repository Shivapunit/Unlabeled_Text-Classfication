# Unlabeled_Text-Classfication

Product categorisation on user's Product Review

## Ontologies might be helpful if the relationships you are looking for are general enough (i.e. Hair and Shampoo). But their is a chance a same word appear in different topics or user reviews with different intent or correlationÂ¶

### Hence we're gooing for manual product naming as per described Topics

  Topic {1} : Toileteries Product
  Topic {2} : Pet Prodcut
  Topic {3} : Toy Product
  Topic {4} : Sports Product
  Topic {5} : Food Proudct
  Topic {6} : House Item Product
  Topic {7} : Exterior Product
